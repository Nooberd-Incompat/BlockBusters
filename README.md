# Decentralized Rare Disease Registry

## Overview

The Decentralized Rare Disease Registry aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for managing and sharing rare disease data. This project combines Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and OrbitDB for decentralized database functionality to create a robust and scalable solution for the rare disease community.

## Problem Statement

Rare disease data is often fragmented and difficult to access, hindering research and collaboration. Our solution addresses these issues by creating a decentralized registry that ensures data integrity, security, and accessibility.

## Solution Approach

Our platform provides a decentralized and secure environment for patients, researchers, and doctors to submit, share, and access rare disease data. By using blockchain and decentralized storage, we ensure data integrity and transparency while maintaining user privacy through encryption and secure authentication methods.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum, IPFS
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Backend Services**: Node.js, Express.js, OrbitDB
- **Frontend Application**: React.js, Web3.js
- **Security**: MetaMask, data encryption

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user authentication using MetaMask.
- **Data Submission and Storage**: Encrypted data storage on IPFS with smart contract-based registry.
- **Data Retrieval and Sharing**: Controlled data access via smart contracts.
- **Research Collaboration**: Platform for proposing, voting, and funding research projects.
- **Community Building**: Forums and chat features for decentralized social interactions.

## Implementation Guide

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Node.js, npm, and Truffle framework
   - Set up a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache) for testing

2. **Design and Develop Smart Contracts**
   - Create Registry, Identity, and Data Sharing contracts using Solidity
   - Test contracts thoroughly using Truffle

3. **Implement IPFS Integration**
   - Set up IPFS node
   - Develop functions to store and retrieve data from IPFS

4. **Develop Backend Services**
   - Set up Node.js server with Express.js
   - Implement API endpoints for interacting with smart contracts and IPFS
   - Integrate OrbitDB for decentralized database functionality

5. **Create Frontend Application**
   - Set up React.js project
   - Implement user interface for data submission, retrieval, and community features
   - Integrate Web3.js for blockchain interactions

6. **Implement Security Measures**
   - Set up MetaMask integration for user authentication
   - Implement encryption/decryption for sensitive data

7. **Develop Community Features**
   - Implement forums and chat using OrbitDB

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Conduct thorough testing of all components
   - Perform security audits

9. **Deployment**
   - Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum mainnet or a suitable testnet
   - Deploy backend to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
   - Deploy frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)

10. **Documentation and Training**
    - Create user guides and API documentation
    - Develop training materials for different user roles

11. **Launch and Maintenance**
    - Soft launch to a limited user base
    - Gather feedback and iterate
    - Implement a system for ongoing maintenance and updates
